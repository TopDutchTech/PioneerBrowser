## Plan

We are building a fully featured Web Browser based on web technologies for the modern web.

We are using node js with electron, but plan to be switching to tauri soon.

Version 1.0 will be shipped with electron, but after that we will rewrite the browser in tauri. 
Eventually we plan to rewrite the project in rust, but that is a really long time away right now.


## Features

Currently it is a single page browser, without tab switcher, and minimal css styling. 
We are working very hard, and we dont want to rush, but more features are coming in the future.

## How to Build 

You can build by using the build instructions on the website[PioneerBrowser](TopDutchTech.github.io/PioneerBrowser/Docs/Building.html)
